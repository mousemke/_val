erm.... bot.

Go to http://knoblau.ch/_val for a list of commands.

If you would like to have _val running on your irc/slack/twitch/whatever in our hosting pool let us know.  The hosting pool is run on an EC2 instance and is funded only by donations.  It's a good way to have your bots running without having to worry about it.
