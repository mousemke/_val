 # _val an irc bot, dogecoin tip bot, and all around good person.

erm.... bot.

v. 1.1.0

`requires node 10+`

## install

```
npm i val-bot
```

if you hit issues on mac with `node-icu-charset-detector` you may need xcode command line developer tools

`xcode-select --install`.

## Running val

+ Change the `_val.config.js` and `_val.modules.js` in `./config` where appropriate
+ `npm run serve`

Use `${trigger}help` for a list of commands.


## scripts


| `script` | description |
|----------|-------------|
| `npm run serve` | starts _val in Xvfb mode (recommended) |
| `npm run serveAlt` | starts _val in simple mode. nightmare commands may not work |
| `npm run away` | starts awaybot as a placeholder |



 If you would like to have _val running on your irc/slack/twitch/whatever in our hosting pool let us know.  The hosting pool is run on an EC2 instance and is funded only by donations.  It's a good way to have your bots running without having to worry about it.

All json configuration files are missing.  Be sure to copy the example files to the correct name.

 Feel free to donate to keep _val's hosting server up and running!
